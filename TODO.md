To do:
- Single, and double, quotation marks look funny, in the terminal,
  when they're pickled and I think that this is because of the
  sloppy `sed` command that I ran to replace the single
  quotation marks with the double quotation marks. This would
  probably be a good time to review the "stop words" and
  see if there are any other "stop words" that should be added
  to ignore.py--especially jargon that is related to finance.

- The front-end could look better.

- It'd be nice to write this to Postgres, but that was such
  a pain in the ass, last time; I'd rather focus on doubling
  down on sentiment analysis so Katabasis can generate
  original data from audio (utterance_transcriber); video
  (frame_grabber); images (ie. frames)(object_tracer); and
  text (ie. documents)(screen_scrapers).

- Now: sentiment analysis
